<h2>Email teachers when checklist is complete</h2>
<p>When a checklist is complete (either the student has ticked off all the items, for a student only checklist; or the teacher has ticked off all the items, for any other type of checklist), a notification email is sent to all the teachers on the course.</p>
<p>An administrator can control who receives this email using the capability 'mod:checklist/emailoncomplete' - by default all teachers and non-editing teachers have this capability.</p>
