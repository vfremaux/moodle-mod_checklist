<h2>Check-off modules when complete</h2>
<p>This will automatically check-off items in your checklist when you complete the relevant activity in the course.</p>
<p>'Completing' an activity varies from one activity to another - 'view' a resource, 'submit' a quiz or assignment, 'post' to a forum or join in with a chat, etc.</p>
<p>For details of exactly what causes an activity to be marked as 'complete', ask your site administrator to look in the file 'mod/checklist/autoupdate.php'</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> the checkmark changes can take up to 60 seconds after the student has 'completed' an activity, unless your site administrator has made some changes to the files in the default Moodle install. Full instructions for doing this can be found in the README.txt file included when this plugin was downloaded</p>
